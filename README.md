# Fall 2024 CS 3200 Project: PeerPath

PeerPath is a data-driven platform that allows connections to be made among Northeastern students with a focal point of the Northeastern co-op experience. We work to solve the challenges of isolation and limited networking opportunities that many students face when starting at a new co-op, and after being on co-op. Our platform provides ways for students to easily connect, share advice, and build relationships. PeerPath is designed specifically for students who are looking for advice on their co-op searches, and for students who have been on co-op but are looking to stay connected with their peers, and give back to their community. By giving students the space to actively give and seek advice, it fosters an environment that is beneficial to both parties. We are building PeerPath to have two primary user personas. One of these personas is students who have not yet been on co-op and are currently looking, and the other is students who have already completed one or more co-ops. Our key features include, but are not limited to, employer-based reviews, advice-seeking forums, and a data-driven mentorship matching tool, all aiming to help students find a sense of belonging in an isolated environment.

PeerPath: an unfiltered network for professional development.

## Personas

### Persona 1: Jerry

Story:
Jerry is a 2nd year data science student who is currently in the process of searching for a co-op for the first time. Jerry finds the co-op application process very nerve-wracking, and wishes that he could easily access honest insights about specific roles. Currently, Jerry finds it daunting to approach older students who have been on co-op, as he is unsure if they are able and willing to offer in-depth guidance. He will use PeerPath to connect with upperclassmen who have already been on co-op in order to get a unique and experienced perspective on any specific questions he may have.

Pain Points:
- Lack of knowledge about what a co-op would truly end up being like, as job descriptions can be misleading.
- Feelings of isolation and/or as if nobody is able to help with making decisions and discussing thoughts.

Needs:
- People who are or have been in similar situations, such as co-ops away from Boston, jobs in a particular industry or company, or dealing with quick decision deadlines.
- A support system that understands the unique co-op experience.
- A way to find friends who will be on co-ops that are similar in nature, in the same area, or with the same company.

User Stories for Jerry:
1. (1.1) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to see advice from people who landed roles I am interested in so that I know how to approach my application/interviews.
2. (1.2) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to access resources that others found helpful in their co-op searches so that I can get a headstart on my search.
3. (1.3) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to view employer-specific ratings and reviews from people who have been on co-op so that I can feel confident in both my application as well as my final decision of where to go on co-op.
4. (1.4) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to connect with peers who are going through the same process as I am so that I do not feel like I am going through this alone.
5. (1.5) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to update my co-op search status (searching, interviewing, deciding, etc) so that the advice I am getting is tailored to my current situation.
6. (1.6) As a student looking for my first co-op, I need to be able to update my urgency status (Green, Yellow, Red, etc.) so that people can prioritize myself or others based on how urgent our situations are.  

### Persona 2: Jordan

Story:
Jordan is a 4th year undergraduate student studying computer science who has just completed his second co-op. Jordan is looking to share about his experiences both searching for co-op and being on co-op. He will be using PeerPath as a way to give back to his Northeastern community while continuing to build his network and hear about his peer’s co-op experiences. Currently, he gets the occasional LinkedIn message from someone applying to a role he had, but they are usually just looking for a recommendation, and he doesn’t play as much of an active role in sharing his experiences as he would like to.

Pain Points:
- Challenging to stay connected with peers and limited in their professional networking to the confines of their own co-ops.
- Has valuable insights to share on the co-op search, but lacks a platform to effectively communicate those insights to others.
- Feels an obligation to share how their experience was with a specific employer, but does not have a structured setting to do so.

Needs:
- An outlet to express his honest opinions on his co-op experience.
- People who are in a similar situation as he was before he went on co-op to share his insights with.
- A way to keep up with his peers’ co-op experiences.

User Stories for Jordan:
1. (2.1) As a student who has been on co-op, I need to be able to rate my co-op experience on different attributes so that students who are looking to get something specific out of co-op are able to make a more informed decision.
2. (2.2) As a student who has been off-campus for two of my last three semesters, I need to be able to stay connected with peers so I can expand my network beyond my own co-op placements.
3. (2.3) As a student who wants to give back to my community, I need to be able to take an active role in giving advice so that I am not relying on others to reach out to me all the time.
4. (2.4) As a student who has answered the same question multiple times on LinkedIn, I need a more organized platform to share my answers to common questions so that I am not spending time answering something I have already answered.
5. (2.5) As a student who has gone through the co-op search process, I need to be able to share valuable resources that helped me through my co-op search so that others do not have to start from the ground up like I did.
6. (2.6) As a student who has been on co-op, I need to be able to give a comprehensive employer review for each of my co-ops, expanding on areas such as company culture, day-to-day tasks, return offer, etc. so that co-op searchers can have a more qualitative view on things beyond the ratings I give.

### Persona 3: Stacy

Story:
Stacy, who works in Northeastern’s co-op department, finds that students are often surprised, disappointed, or feel misled with the responsibilities of their specific co-op. Stacy’s goal is to minimize such negative experiences, and consequently increase co-op satisfaction. This will be beneficial to Northeastern’s reputation - more students will view co-op, a major part of the Northeastern experience, positively. Furthermore, companies will have better experiences with co-op students who enjoy their roles, and will want to hire more in the future. Stacy will use PeerPath to track co-op satisfaction levels. She will then use these findings to create reports and recommendations about the co-op system and how administrators can better support students searching for a co-op.

Pain Points:
- Not receiving as much input from students about their co-op experiences as desired.
- Not having enough data to measure the effectiveness of co-op coordinators.

Needs:
- Database with enough information to make reliable and relatively accurate determinations.

User Stories for Persona 3:
1. (3.1) As a decision maker, I need to be able to compare employer ratings in the same industry so that I know what kinds of companies are beneficial to the Northeastern co-op program, and what kinds are not.
2. (3.2) As a decision maker, I need to be able to access filtered data based on industry, location, etc. so that I can give more informed answers on specific questions about the co-op program.
3. (3.3) As a decision maker, I need to be able to identify which co-op coordinators are resulting in higher and lower satisfaction so that I can figure out what is helpful and what is not helpful to students.
4. (3.4) As a decision maker, I need to identify common factors leading to student disappointment, so that I can develop strategies to set clearer expectations and better prepare students.
5. (3.5) As a decision maker, I need to be able to view the change in different satisfaction aspects over time so that I can reflect on what changes we made to the co-op curriculum were successful.
6. (3.6) As a decision maker, I need to be able to reach out to specific students that I think have good advice so that I can get some more specific information from them.

### Persona 4: Phil

Story:
Phil is a system administrator for PeerPath. As such, his goal is to maintain the program’s integrity and efficiency. Phil’s main concerns are being able to moderate the platform to ensure advice is legitimate, manage user/site activity, and view help requests. Overall, Phil wants to be able to perform his job to the best of his ability - ensuring the high performance of PeerPath.

Pain Points:
- Ensuring the integrity of information on the platform can be challenging - some students may lie or provide poor advice.

Needs:
To be able to ensure that the platform is working optimally.

User Stories for Persona 4:
1. (4.1) As a system administrator, I need to be able to remove inaccurate or poor advice so that users have a more positive experience with the platform.
2. (4.2) As a system administrator, I need to be able to remove users that are too old, not verified, or repeatedly violate the platform’s terms and conditions so that the site remains a legitimate community for co-op help.
3. (4.3) As a system administrator, I need to be able to view site activity across different metrics so that I am able to understand current performance and potential areas for improvement.
4. (4.4) As a system administrator, I need to be able to manage user permissions so that the platform functions optimally and to each user’s advantage.
5. (4.5) As a system administrator, I need to be able to view reports, reviews, and support requests from users so that I can receive feedback on the site’s functionality in order to create improvements.
6. (4.6) As a system administrator, I need to be able to send system notifications, such as maintenance downtime and site updates, to users so that they remain informed on the status of the site.

## Current Project Components

Currently, there are three major components which will each run in their own Docker Containers:

- Streamlit App in the `./app` directory
- Flask REST api in the `./api` directory
- SQL files for your data model and data base in the `./database-files` directory

## Controlling the Containers

- `docker compose up -d` to start all the containers in the background
- `docker compose down` to shutdown and delete the containers
- `docker compose up db -d` only start the database container (replace db with the other services as needed)
- `docker compose stop` to "turn off" the containers but not delete them.
